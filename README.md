# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines in object-oriented programming that help developers create more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each principle in simple terms:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**What it means**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Why it matters**: If a class has only one job, it makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. Changes in one part of the software will be less likely to affect other parts.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**What it means**: Software entities (like classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Why it matters**: You should be able to add new features to a class without changing its existing code. This minimizes the risk of introducing bugs when you add new functionality.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**What it means**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Why it matters**: If a subclass can stand in for a superclass, the program can be more flexible and can handle different types of objects in a uniform way.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**What it means**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Interfaces should be small and specific to the client's needs.

**Why it matters**: By creating more focused interfaces, you make the system easier to understand and change. Clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**What it means**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Why it matters**: This principle reduces the coupling between different parts of the code, making it easier to change and maintain. It also makes the code more reusable and testable.
